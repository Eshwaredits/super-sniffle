# Instagram Automation
Scripts to automate processes on Instagram for page growth. All the scripts implement the Instagram API. I used this for my meme page and to gain 10k+ followers.

NOTE: This code is no longer maintaned, as the instagram detects bots :(

## Get Started

Setup git: https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git#setting-up-git

To get started, make a new folder download and setup the repo with the following commands in Terminal (Mac) or Command Line (Windows):

	git clone https://github.com/nang149/InstagramAutomation.git
	cd InstagramAutomation
	git submodule init 
	git submodule update

You might have to install some dependencies that aren't on your computer. To do this, setup pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) and install the dependencies:
ie. "pip install requests_toolbelt"
	
To get started, take a look around at the files: bot_followusers and bot_followusers. If you put in your account info, it will work :)

## How To Run
Setup python and type in: "python bot_followusers.py" in Terminal (Mac) or CMD (Windows) after putting in your info. Note that this is safe, as it just passes it to the API.
